 Case Study on Fuzzy Logic and Its Operators
‚ú® Introduction
Fuzzy Logic is a way of making decisions more like humans do. Unlike regular logic that only uses 0 or 1 (true or false), fuzzy logic can take values between 0 and 1. This helps machines understand real-world situations where things aren't just black or white, but somewhere in between.

For example, instead of saying "the room is hot" or "the room is cold", fuzzy logic can say "the room is somewhat warm".

üå°Ô∏è Real-Life Example: Smart Fan
Let‚Äôs take an example of a smart fan. We want the fan to adjust its speed based on:

Temperature (cold, warm, hot)

Humidity (dry, normal, humid)

Instead of fixed rules, fuzzy logic allows smooth transitions.

‚öôÔ∏è Fuzzy Operators
In fuzzy logic, we use three main operators:

AND (Minimum)

Takes the lowest value between two inputs

Example: If temp is 0.6 and humidity is 0.8, then
AND = min(0.6, 0.8) = 0.6

OR (Maximum)

Takes the highest value between two inputs

Example: If temp is 0.6 and humidity is 0.8, then
OR = max(0.6, 0.8) = 0.8

NOT (Complement)

Reverses the value

Example: If dryness = 0.3, then
NOT dryness = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7

üß† Sample Rule
Let‚Äôs say we have a rule:

IF temperature is hot AND humidity is humid, THEN fan speed is high

If:

Temperature is 0.7 (hot)

Humidity is 0.5 (humid)

Then:

Rule strength = min(0.7, 0.5) = 0.5

So, the fan will run at 50% power

‚úÖ Conclusion
Fuzzy logic is useful when we need machines to make decisions in a human-like way. It works well in systems where values are not just true or false but lie somewhere in between. By using simple operators like AND, OR, and NOT, fuzzy logic helps build smart devices like air conditioners, fans, and even washing machines.
